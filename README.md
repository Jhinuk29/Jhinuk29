Introduction
I’m a complete beginner in app development and am currently focused on learning how to create basic applications. I'm working on both mobile app development (Android and iOS) and cross-platform app development to get a broad understanding of the field.

This repo is where I’ll store my projects, code snippets, and resources as I continue to build my app development skills.

Current Focus:
Learning mobile app development for Android using Java and Kotlin.
Exploring cross-platform development using Flutter and Dart.
Understanding how to build simple user interfaces, implement basic functionality, and deploy apps.
Technologies I'm Learning
Here are the technologies I’m learning to build my app development skills:

Java & Kotlin: For building native Android apps.
Flutter & Dart: For creating cross-platform apps (Android and iOS) from a single codebase.
Android Studio: The official IDE for Android development.
Xcode: For iOS development (if applicable in the future).
Firebase: For cloud storage, authentication, and real-time databases.
Git: For version control and collaboration.
UI/UX Design Principles: Learning how to design intuitive interfaces and user experiences.

My Learning Goals
As a beginner app developer, here are the goals I’m working towards:

Learning Java & Kotlin: Understanding how to create native Android apps.
Building Cross-Platform Apps: Exploring how to develop apps using Flutter and Dart, to target both Android and iOS.
UI/UX Design: Learning how to design user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces.
Firebase Integration: Gaining knowledge on how to use Firebase for things like authentication, databases, and cloud storage in mobile apps.
App Deployment: Understanding how to deploy apps to the Google Play Store (Android) and the Apple App Store (iOS).
Problem-Solving Skills: Developing my problem-solving and coding logic through challenges, exercises, and small projects.
